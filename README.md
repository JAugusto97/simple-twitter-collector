A simple tweet collector wrapper built on top of tweepy and optionally integrated with Google Drive. It will collect all the tweet, user, media and location fields and dump it to a json file.

## üèÉ How to Run
1. Install the dependencies:  
```pip3 install -r requirements.txt```
2. Follow these [instructions](https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/twitter-api/getting-started/getting-access-to-the-twitter-api) to get your Twitter API keys. Paste your Twitter API keys inside **credentials/twitter_credentials.json** 
3. (Optional) Follow these [instructions](https://developers.google.com/drive/api/v3/about-auth#OAuth2Authorizing) to get your Google Drive API keys. Download the **client_secrets.json** file and place it into **credentials/client_secrets.json**
4. Modify the **config.yaml** file with your desired configurations.
5. Run:  
   ```python3 collect_tweets.py```

## üîß Configuration File
You can modify the **config.yaml** file to suit your needs. Some fields are optional if you want to upload your files to Google Drive. Below you will find the description of the fields you can modify. Required fields are in bold.

- credentials
  - **twitter_credentials** (str): path to your Twitter API credentials file.
  - google_drive_credentials (str, optional): path to your Google Drive API credentials file.
- storage
  - gdrive_folder_id (str, optional): Google Drive folder ID where your tweets will be dumped into. To get this, simply create or access the desired folder inside your Google Drive and copy the url after "/folders/": https://drive.google.com/drive/u/1/folders/<folder_id>
  - **dump_to_google_drive** (bool): true if you want to upload your tweets to Google Drive (must set other related parameters) or false if you want to save them locally.
  - **local_folder** (str): a local folder path to save the tweets into.
- collector
  - **task_id** (str): your tweets will be saved inside a folder with this name, either locally or on Google Drive. It does not override the folder if it already exists. You can use this to keep track of multiple tweet collection tasks.
  - **query** (str): will collect the tweets mentioning this string. You can create more sophisticated Twitter queries that suit your needs using this [documentation](https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/twitter-api/tweets/search/integrate/build-a-query). 
  - max_results (int, optional): collect up to this number of tweets. If null, will collect everything.
  - dump_batch_size (int, optional): dump a batch of this number of tweets. If null, will dump a single file containing every tweet.

## ‚ùó Academic Research Access
If your API keys have default access, some of the fields retrieved (like places) will always be empty, because you don't have access to that. If you're a researcher, you can ask Twitter for elevated access [here](https://developer.twitter.com/en/products/twitter-api/academic-research).
